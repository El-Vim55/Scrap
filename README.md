# Scrap
A simple RPi Web Scraper written in python

__Aim__:
The aim of the project is to find the Title, Availability and Price of the CM4 RaspberryPi from some of Australia's Pi vendors.

__Current Plan__:
I plan to make a simple web application for this project in which I will use html/css for the frontend and the backend will be node.js
I will first scrape from *Core Electronics* -- a well known Pi vendor -- and take it from there. 

__Future Plan__:
Asynchronously scrape data using the *asyncio* and *aiohttp* modules
